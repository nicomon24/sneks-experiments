# DQN
In this phase, we are going to implement a basic version of the famous [DQN algorithm](https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/dqn/DQNNaturePaper.pdf).
We will loosely follow the code from this [PyTorch tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/reinforcement_q_learning.html).
